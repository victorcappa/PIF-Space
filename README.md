<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

 
<p align="left">
 <p> This project was created to immerse the user in a 3D enviroment that uses game mechanics (like collectables and interactions) to demonstrate some of the inovation and investments done by the PIF.</p>
 
  <h3>Challenges</h3
   <p>
On this project, I worked mostly creating VFX, using Unity's particle system, as well as visual scripting and C#. The biggest challenges where related to performance, animations and creating a visual interesting experience. I was also resposible for composing the enviroment with different objects that worked as in-game displays.
